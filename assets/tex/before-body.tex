{Indiana University Indianapolis is located on the traditional and ancestral territory of the Myaamia (Miami), Kaskaskia, and Kiikaapoi (Kickapoo) peoples. The campus was built on the site of a vibrant Black community, also displaced. This land acknowledgment is a small step in our ongoing responsibility to the land we occupy and we recognize that we are its caretakers, not its sole owners. The CEnTR*IMPACT project was conceived and conducted to honor their traditions, power, agency, and voice. \par}
