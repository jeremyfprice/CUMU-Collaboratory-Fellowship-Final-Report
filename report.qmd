# CEnTR*IMPACT: Metrics for Community Engaged Research

::: {.callout-note}

## The Goal of CENTR*IMPACT

To create heuristics that help community engaged researchers understand and evaluate their work and to help them share their stories of their work with colleagues, funders, partners, etc.
:::

## Existing Work in Reflecting, Reporting, and Evaluating Community Engaged Scholarship


## Situating Metrics

Iceberg or something: metrics are the very top, shortcuts or heuristics for lots of meaning. Can/should be combined with other tools such as TRES (https://servicelearning.indianapolis.iu.edu/teaching-research/tools-instruments/tres/index.html), as these other tools provide deeper insights and more robust information. Metrics should be used to **help** tell the story, they should not be the story in and of themselves.

## Metrics as Single-Value Indicators for Consequential Decision Making

Don't do it.

# Development Process

Here's what we did

# Current Design and Status of CEnTR*IMPACT

## Project Impacts

$$
S_{ci} = (\prod^n_{i=1}s_i)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

## Ripple Effects

$$
\eta_i = \lambda_i(N_i+(\phi C_i))
$$

$$
\eta_O = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}\eta_i}{n}
$$

# CEnTR*IMPACT in Use

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-overflow: wrap
node_frame <- network_frame |>
  select(-from) %>%
  distinct(to, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  rename(node = to) %>%
  arrange(node) %>%
  mutate(dd = diffusion.degree(network_graph)) %>%
  mutate(pr = page_rank(network_graph, directed = TRUE)$vector) %>%
  mutate(node_mu = dd * pr)
```

# Continued Trajectories

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
